## Tips & Best Practices

### üìÖ Understanding Week Boundaries
- All weeks run **Monday through Sunday**
- "Current Week" starts on the most recent Monday
- "Past Week" is the complete Monday-Sunday week before current

### üìä Building Historical Data
- Fetch analytics regularly to build trend history
- Use **Auto-refresh** to keep data current
- Historical data stores up to 30 data points per campaign
- Data persists in browser localStorage

### üéØ Finding Patterns
1. Look for consistent upward trends in reply rates
2. Check if certain weeks perform better (seasonal patterns)
3. Compare week-over-week to identify improvements from changes
4. Use monthly view for broader trends

### üí° Common Use Cases

**Weekly Performance Review**
- Select "Current Week"
- Compare with "Past Week"
- Check week-over-week summary for quick insights

**Monthly Reporting**
- Select "This Month"
- Export CSV for stakeholder reports

**Historical Analysis**

- Compare same week from different periods
- Identify seasonal patterns or campaign changes impact

**Custom Period Analysis**
- Use "Custom Range" for quarter reviews

## Troubleshooting

### "No historical trend data showing"
- **Cause**: Need at least 2 data fetches to show trends
- **Solution**: Fetch analytics multiple times over different days/weeks

### "Week selector not working"
- **Cause**: Future weeks are disabled (can't see future data)
- **Solution**: Use left arrow to go to past weeks only

### "Custom range not filtering"
- **Cause**: Start and End dates not both selected
- **Solution**: Make sure both date fields are filled in

### "Charts look empty"
- **Cause**: Selected date range has no data
- **Solution**: Try "All Time" filter or select a different range

## Advanced Features
